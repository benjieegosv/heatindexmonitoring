        <p>
            You have the right to request that we delete your personal data under certain circumstances, such as when it is no longer necessary for us to retain it, or if you withdraw your consent to its processing.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Right to Data Portability</h2>
        <p>
            You have the right to request a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. This allows you to transfer your data to another service provider if you choose to do so.

        <p>
            You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data when it is based on legitimate interests, including profiling, or if it is used for direct marketing purposes.

        <p>
            If you have provided consent for the processing of your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
